Code and Data repo for the paper "Modeling attention control using a convolutional neural network designed after the ventral visual pathway"

Paper link: http://www.chenpingyu.org/docs/Yu_2019.pdf

For our previous work that introduced the concept of Category Consistent Features using Bag-of-Words models: http://www.chenpingyu.org/docs/Yu_ccf_2016.pdf


Both VsNet and Deep-HMAX was implemented using Torch7, the model definition files are now included with this repo, and you can download the trained models (on the SBU-68E dataset) here below:

VsNet: https://www.dropbox.com/s/v3z04mxypwza36a/trained_model_VsNet.t7?dl=1

Deep-HMAX: https://www.dropbox.com/s/22py38oniktofvh/trained_model_deep_hmax.t7?dl=1

Finally, the dataset that was used to train both VsNet and Deep-HMAX is included here as the SBU-68E dataset.
